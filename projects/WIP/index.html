	<h4 class="title">Identity</h4>
	<p class="content">The Works in Progress show was an exhibition hosted by the Chan Gallery at Pomona College. I was tasked with creating the identity for the show as well as collateral such as posters and vinyls. The show highlighted unfinished works or works where the processs is clear in the final product. My design places importance in the idea of process.</p>
	<h4 class="title">Concept</h4>
	<p class="content">One of the main challenges I dealt with in designing this show was conveying the idea of a work in progress through a finished design. The imagery I decided to focus on was surrounding structure and development. </p>
	<h4 class="title">Poster</h4>
	<div class="bg">
		<img src="images/poster_install_close.jpg" width="40%" height="auto" style="margin-left: 10%;" alt="Cover Photo"/>
		<img src="images/poster_install.jpg" width="40%" height="auto" style="margin-left: 0%;" alt="Cover Photo"/>
	</div>
	<p class="comment">The poster for the event was installed as a headline for the event.</p>
	<p class="content">I utilized the layering inherent in screen printing to create the effect of a compounding structure. In multiple elements of the design the process is present in the final design.</p>

	<p class="comment">The final vinyl design for the entrance to the show.</p>
	<p class="content">The logo used for the vinyl design pulls elements from the poster design. In a sense the poster was used as a drawing board for the logo design.</p>
