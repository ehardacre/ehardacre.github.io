  	<p style="margin-left: 20px;"> My work is a constant exploration of different styles, media, forms and motifs. I would like to think that as a whole, they paint a cohesive picture of the themes and stylistic elements that interest me. My process of creation tends to work in short bursts lasting somewhere between a few days and an entire year. During these periods my works are linked either stylistically or thematically. Some particularly fruitful periods in my artistic career are highlighted in the menu to the left. </p>
